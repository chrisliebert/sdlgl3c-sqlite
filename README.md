# sdlgl3c-sqlite
A 3D OpenGL 3 renderer written in C with bindings for Java and LuaJIT capable of loading 3D models from an SQLite database.
This project is derived from https://github.com/chrisliebert/sdlgl3-wavefront. A sub-project called obj2sqlite is a C++ tool for storing 3D information from a Wavefront file in an SQLite .db file. 3D geometry, normal coordinates, texture coordinates, material definitions, properties and textures are stored in the database. Initial processing seen in sdlgl3-wavefront has moved to obj2sqlite such as vertex dereferencing and bounding sphere calculation. The database is optimized for fast loading rather than space efficiancy; floating point data values are interpreted as the binary equivalent integers then stored in the database by obj2sqlite and re-interpreted as floats prior to rendering.
